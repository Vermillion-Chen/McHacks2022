## McHacks 2022 Submission

This project was based off of Railview Analytic's challenge of optimizing a train schedule and then developing a visualization for it.

Using Python, we were able to tune the average wait time down from ~6 minutes to 4.5 minutes, resulting in a 25% decrease in waiting time. Our model decides to use the type of train as a constant and fine tunes the train arrival time in order to achieve optimization
